                MYHC stands for Mental Health Youth Centers. I made it real
                simple, but with complex meaning and strong meaning. The MHYC is
                a nonprofit organization, founded in San Diego by Jonathan
                Dooley an African American engineer who was unnerved by the
                dramatic juxtaposition between the mental health illness created
                by society's image and the high risk of decreasing emotional
                intellect. (To overcome this formidable difficulty/ To vanquish
                thy challenge) Jonathan created a nonprofit that would provide
                the youth and young adults with the materials, a safe space,
                mentors, and counselors they would need to increase their
                emotional intellect and improve their mental health.

                Hey, My name is Jonathan Dooley Im from Compton California and
                i'm the founder and CEO of MHYC. I like to watch anime, listen
                to music, and draw (Sometimes). I am a part of the Hidden Genius
                Project which helped envision my goal. I am a Highschool senior
                who just wants to leave a good impact on the world. I created
                MHYC because I used to struggle with Mental health issues and
                did not have anyone to talk to, especially professionally. So i
                created MHYC for the youth and young adults to have a safe and
                FREE space to deal with problems they might have with their
                mental health

                In envisioning the future of our mental health nonprofit, we see
                a vibrant and compassionate organization that serves as a beacon
                of hope and support for individuals in need. Our comprehensive
                plan includes expanding our outreach programs to underserved
                communities, offering accessible teletherapy services, and
                establishing partnerships with local schools and workplaces to
                promote mental wellness. We aim to create a nurturing
                environment where everyone feels empowered to seek help without
                stigma. Through fundraising efforts and community events, we
                will raise awareness about mental health issues and fund
                innovative research initiatives. Our goal is to foster a society
                where mental health is prioritized and every individual has the
                resources they need to thrive emotionally and psychologically.
                Together, we can build a future where mental health support is
                readily available and no one feels alone in their journey
                towards healing and recovery.
