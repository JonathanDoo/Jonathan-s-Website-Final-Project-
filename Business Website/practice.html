                                    MYHC stands for Mental Health Youth Centers. I made it real
                                    simple, but with complex meaning and strong meaning. The MHYC is
                                    a nonprofit organization, founded in San Diego by Jonathan
                                    Dooley an African American engineer who was unnerved by the
                                    dramatic juxtaposition between the mental health illness created
                                    by society's image and the high risk of decreasing emotional
                                    intellect. (To overcome this formidable difficulty/ To vanquish
                                    thy challenge) Jonathan created a nonprofit that would provide
                                    the youth and young adults with the materials, a safe space,
                                    mentors, and counselors they would need to increase their
                                    emotional intellect and improve their mental health.
